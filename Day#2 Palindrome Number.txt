Palindrome Number

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Code:

/**
 * @param {number} x
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isPalindrome = function(x) {
    if (x < 0 || ((x % 10 == 0) && x !== 0)) {
        return false
    }

    let revert = 0;

    for (let i = x; i; i = Math.trunc(i / 10)) {
        revert = revert * 10 + i % 10
    }

    return revert == x
};
